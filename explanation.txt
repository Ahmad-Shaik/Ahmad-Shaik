--->Creating a Planet Animation with HTML and CSS
--->Introduction:
In this code example, we will create a simple animation of a planet system using HTML and CSS. The animation consists of a sun, an earth, and a moon orbiting around the earth.

--->Key Concepts:
To create this animation, we will utilize the following key concepts:

--->HTML structure: We will use HTML tags to define the structure of the animation.
--->CSS styling: We will apply CSS styles to customize the appearance of the elements.
--->CSS animations: We will use CSS animations to create the orbiting effect.
--->Code Structure:
The code is structured as follows:

The HTML structure is defined within the <body> tag.
The CSS styles are defined within the <style> tag, which is placed within the <head> tag.
Explanation of the Code
Let's break down the code and understand how each part contributes to the animation:

The <style> tag contains CSS styles that define the appearance and behavior of the elements.
The body selector sets the background color to black and centers the animation on the screen.
The .container class defines the size and position of the planet system.
The .sun class represents the sun and is styled with a yellow background color and a white box shadow to create a glowing effect.
The .earth and .moon classes represent the earth and the moon, respectively. They are positioned absolutely and styled with a border to create a circular shape.
The .earth class is animated using the orbit animation, which rotates the earth 360 degrees over a duration of 36.5 seconds.
The .moon class is also animated using the orbit animation, but with a shorter duration of 2.7 seconds.
The ::before pseudo-element is used to create the aqua-colored earth core and the silver-colored moon core.
--->Conclusion:
In this code example, we have created a simple planet animation using HTML and CSS. By understanding the key concepts of HTML structure, CSS styling, and CSS animations,
we were able to create an engaging and visually appealing animation. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different styles and animations to create
your own unique planet system. Happy coding!
